## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

Calling a masked function

Read in data from Mike Byerly. 2016. Alaska commercial salmon catches by management region (1886- 1997). Gulf of Alaska Data Portal. df35b.304.2.
```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```


```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum) 
```

```{r}
#catch_df %>% 
  #select(-All, -notesRegCode) 

```
```{r}
catch_df <-catch_df %>% 
  gather(key="species", value = "catch", -Region, -Year)
head(catch_df)
unique(catch_df$species)
```
```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)

unique(catch_df$species)
head(catch_df)
```


# A way to check for unique values
```{r}
unique(catch_df$species)
```

```{r}
catch_integers<- as.integer(catch_df$catch_thousands)

i <- which(is.na(catch_integers)==T)

catch_df$catch_thousands[i]
```

1) turn "I" into 1 in the catch_thousands column
2) coerce catch_thousands into integer type
3) convert catch_thousands to catch
```{r}
catch_df <- catch_df %>% 
 mutate(catch_thousands = ifelse(catch_thousands == "I", 1,  catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch_thousands = as.integer(catch_thousands)) %>% 
  mutate(catch=catch_thousands*1000) %>% 
  tail()
```
